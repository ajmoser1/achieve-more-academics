 Implement the following plan:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  Plan: Achieve More Academics Website

  Context

  I run "Achieve More Academics", a STEM + ACT/SAT prep tutoring business for middle/high schoolers. I have 2 active tutors and 2 idle ACT/SAT tutors. Sessions are primarily online. The website's #1 goal is
  convincing parents of credibility so they book a session. Currently there is no website.

  Tech Stack

  - Framework: Astro 5 — ships zero JavaScript by default, blazing fast, great SEO
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
  - Contact Form: Web3Forms (free, no backend needed — sends submissions to email)
  - Booking: Calendly inline embed
  - Hosting: Netlify (free tier) — auto-builds from GitHub, auto HTTPS, deploy previews
  - Location: ~/GitHub/achieve-more-academics/

  Color Scheme: Navy + White + Gold (Academic Authority)

  - Primary: Navy #1B365D (trust, professionalism)
  - Background: White/Light gray #F8F9FA
  - Accent: Amber/Gold #D4A843 (achievement, excellence)
  - Text: Dark charcoal #2D3436
  - Success/growth: Muted green #2E7D5B

  Site Structure (Single-Page with Anchor Navigation)

  A single long-scroll page with a sticky header. This converts better than multi-page for a small tutoring business — parents can evaluate, trust, and book without clicking around.

  Sections (in order):

  1. Hero — Benefit-driven headline ("Help Your Child Master STEM & Ace the SAT"), subheadline with specifics, "Book a Free Consultation" CTA button, micro-proof ("Trusted by X families")
  2. Stats Bar — 3-4 metrics in a horizontal row (e.g., "150+ Students Helped | Avg 4.8★ Rating | 120+ Avg SAT Point Increase | Est. 2024")
  3. Services — 3-4 cards: STEM Tutoring, ACT Prep, SAT Prep, with grade levels and brief descriptions
  4. Our Story (About/Credibility) — Alex's photo, personal story, why he started tutoring, qualifications, teaching philosophy. Mention the team briefly.
  5. Results & Testimonials — Parent testimonials with names and context, score improvement examples, CTA repeated
  6. How It Works — 3 steps: Book a Free Consultation → Get a Custom Plan → Watch Them Achieve More
  7. FAQ — Common parent questions (subjects, online/in-person, cost range, tutor matching). Also good for SEO.
  8. Book a Session — Embedded Calendly widget
  9. Contact Form — Name, email, phone, student grade, subject/need, message. Powered by Web3Forms.
  10. Footer — Contact info, social links, copyright

  Additional:

  - Sticky header with nav links to each section + a "Book Now" button always visible
  - Mobile-responsive (mobile-first design)
  - JSON-LD LocalBusiness schema for local SEO
  - Sitemap auto-generated by Astro

  Implementation Steps

  Step 1: Project Setup

  - Create ~/GitHub/achieve-more-academics/
  - npm create astro@latest with Tailwind
  - Configure Tailwind with the custom color palette
  - Set up project structure

  Step 2: Layout & Header

  - Create base layout with <head> (meta tags, JSON-LD schema, fonts)
  - Build sticky header/nav with section links + "Book Now" CTA
  - Mobile hamburger menu

  Step 3: Build Sections (top to bottom)

  - Hero section with CTA
  - Stats bar
  - Services cards
  - Our Story section (placeholder for Alex's photo/bio)
  - Testimonials section (placeholder testimonials Alex can replace)
  - How It Works (3-step process)
  - FAQ accordion
  - Calendly embed section
  - Contact form (Web3Forms integration)
  - Footer

  Step 4: Polish

  - Responsive design pass (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Smooth scroll behavior for anchor links
  - Subtle scroll animations (fade-in on scroll)
  - Favicon and Open Graph meta tags

  Step 5: Deploy Setup

  - Initialize git repo
  - Create GitHub repository
  - Connect to Netlify for auto-deploy (or document how to do so)

  Placeholder Content

  - Placeholder testimonials (clearly marked as placeholders)
  - Placeholder stats
  - Placeholder bio text
  - Placeholder Calendly URL and Web3Forms access key

  Verification

  - Run npm run dev and verify all sections render correctly
  - Test mobile responsiveness at 375px, 768px, 1024px widths
  - Verify contact form submits (will need real Web3Forms key to fully test)
  - Verify Calendly embed loads (will need real Calendly URL)
  - Run npm run build to ensure clean production build
  - Lighthouse audit for performance/SEO scores

PROMPT 2


  Here's what I need to do next:                                                                                                                                                                                     

  1. Activate the Calendly embed — The Calendly URL is already set in src/pages/index.astro as https://calendly.com/achievemoreacademics. Replace the placeholder div in the "Book a Session" section with the actual
   Calendly inline widget embed and script tag.
  2. Test the contact form — The Web3Forms access key is already set. Verify the form works by checking the integration.
